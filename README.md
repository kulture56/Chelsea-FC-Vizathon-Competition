## **The Challenge** ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/311a7dc5-11e9-475e-a755-e99477448cc8)


* Create the most compelling physical performance interface for elite football players and their coaches.

* Focus on one or more of the visualisation modules. (Load Demand, Injury, Physical Development, Biography, Recovery, External Factors)

* Download our mock dataset or use your own.

* Use a visualisation tool of your choosing!

* Submit your work files along with a written description or short video walk-through highlighting key features and functionality.

**Entries must focus on one or more of the below vizathon modules.**

* **Load Demand**
  E.g Games & matches played, season availability, training sessions and load.

* **Injury History**
  E.g Current injury status, injury risk category, most recent injury.

* **Physical Development**
  E.g Physical test capabilities, development plans, strength & conditioning logs, areas of priority.

* **Biography**
  E.g Players details such as photo, nationality, position, age, team, league.

* **Recovery**
  E.g Nutrition, performance behaviour adherence, sleep, wellness.

* **External Factors**
  E.g Outside influences that may impact an individual's performance. Environmental, dynamics, cohesion, motivation.

* Some data has been made available by CFC to inspire your vizathon entry.
* The data provided acts as a reference, and we welcome individuals to supplement it through other data retrieval methods or creating mock data.
* The data supplied by CFC comes with a data guide to help individuals understand the core metrics.(https://github.com/Chelsea-Fc-Performance-Insights/Competition/blob/main/DATA/CFC%20Vizathon%20Data%20Guide.pdf)
* Any supplementary data used should be based on the modules outlined above, with the data sources referenced in the project.

* **Dataset Name**	           **Dataset Description**
* **GPS:**                	     GPS performance metrics track movement demands, including speed, distance, and acceleration, to assess workload and physical output. This dataset 
                                 contains simulated data for 1 player.
* **Physical Capability:** 	     Physical Capability is measured using a battery of tests which measure different qualities and expressions of force.
* **Recovery Status:**            Recovery status is measured using several tests and metrics to inform recovery strategies throughout the season. This dataset contains simulated data 
                                 for 1 player.
* **Individual Priority:**        Individual priority areas are identified and reviewed by the player and Performance Support Team.
